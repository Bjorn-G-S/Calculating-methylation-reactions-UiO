## General

`Calculating-methylation-reactions` is a python program to be used for 
analyzing GCdata from excel recorded from a MTMTH experiment.
Currently `Calculating-methylation-reactions` is used at the section for catalysis at
the University of Oslo.

## Purpose

Analyze and visualize data from GC measurments taken during methylation experiments with ethylene and propylene

## Installation

Use the program by download to a directory accesible for you python enviornment. The enviornment need to have `python>=3.9.7`, `numpy>=1.21.2`, `pandas>=1.3.3`.


## How-to
How to use the program.


1. Import the program:
```

```
2. Define the directory of the files that are to be converted and the file with the x-vlaues:
```
obj = excel_MTMTH_Calc(Directory=XXXXXX)
```
3. Run the program. the following message will the apear:
